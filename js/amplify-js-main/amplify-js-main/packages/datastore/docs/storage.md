# Storage
## Adapters:
- Web
   - [IndexedDB](../src/storage/adapter/IndexedDBAdapter.ts)
- Mobile
   - React Native
      - [Async Storage](../src/storage/adapter/AsyncStorageAdapter.ts) (can opt in to use SQLite)
- SSR
   - [InMemoryStore](../src/storage/adapter/InMemoryStore.ts)

## How we determine which adapter to use

We determine the storage adapter [here](../src/storage/adapter/getDefaultAdapter/index.ts). 


## [The Storage class](../src/storage/storage.ts)
- The Storage class is what interacts with the adapters.

## [Storage Adapters](../src/storage/adapter)
   1. There is one adapter per database type we support (i.e. three adapters).
   2. Each adapter provides a unified API for the storage engine to interact with.
   3. The SQLite adapter lives [in itâ€™s own package](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-js/tree/main/packages/datastore-storage-adapter).
   4. **ExclusiveStorage wraps public storage methods (e.g. `Storage.runExclusive`)**
      1. Guarantees consistency
      2. Makes the storage class transactional
      3. **Provides concurrency control**

## How DataStore finds records locally:
- Varies by storage adapter
- [SQLiteAdapter](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-js/tree/main/packages/datastore-storage-adapter): DataStore constructs a query. 
- [Async Storage](../src/storage/adapter/AsyncStorageAdapter.ts): DataStore scans and filters. 
- [IndexedDB](../src/storage/adapter/IndexedDBAdapter.ts): if the query is by primary key, DataStore queries against the index, otherwise it scans and filters.
   - *Note: The lazy loading branch includes an improvement to the IndexedDB adapter that will check if any search criteria can leverage an index (there is no preference for low cardinality; the first identified index is used.) If so, the base result is sourced from the index and the remaining criteria will be applied as a filter.*

## Understanding the difference between Save and Batch Save
- As the names imply, `save` accepts a single record and persists it, while `batchSave` accepts a page of records and persists them all. `batchSave`, however, is *only used within the sync processor*, and will filter out deleted records from the sync page results, and then delete them from the local db.
